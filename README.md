# .dotfiles

Some serious gosu dot files

# WTH
Cleaning installing or setting up a new machine shouldn't be a half day job, no matter how enjoyable it is.

This should get me from 0 to 99 in one script.


# Comes with
* Zsh, vim, git, tmux conf
* symlinks from repo to `~/`
* installs homebrew and Brewfile
* installs base16 colours


# Install
```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/danwlsn/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x lego.sh
./lego.sh
```
